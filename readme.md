My Experience Using Copilot
1. What code did Copilot generate?
Copilot assisted me by generating a Python script based on my code comments and initial function signatures. For example, when I started writing a function to [describe the functionality you worked on, e.g., "read data from a file"], Copilot suggested the function body, including error handling and comments.

2. Did you modify the script? If so, why?
Yes, I modified the script generated by Copilot. Some of the changes I made included:

Adjusting variable names to match my project’s naming conventions.
Improving the logic to handle edge cases that Copilot did not anticipate.
Adding or updating comments and docstrings to make the code clearer.
Refactoring the code for better readability and efficiency.
3. How did you test it?
To test the script:

I wrote unit tests using Python’s unittest (or pytest) framework to check different input scenarios.
I ran the script with various input files to make sure it handled errors gracefully.
I used print statements/logging to verify intermediate values during execution.
After confirming the script passed all tests and worked as expected, I committed the changes.
